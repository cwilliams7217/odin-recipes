    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 100 degrees F ( 40 degrees C).
        </li>
            <li>
            Heat mashed strawberries and 1/2 cup white sugar in a saucepan over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
            
            Mix cornstarch and water together in a bowl, then stir into the strawberries.
        </li>
            <li>
            Cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer while preparing remaining ingredients, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
            <li>
            Whisk together the milk and eggs in a bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mash cream cheese, vanilla extract, and 3/4 cup white sugar in a bowl until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the cream cheese mixture over a triangle-shaped piece of bread, and top with another piece. Repeat with remaining bread and cream cheese mixture to make 8 triangle-shaped sandwiches.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip the sandwiches into the egg mixture, 2 or 3 at a time, and place in the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer pan-fried sandwiches to a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven to keep warm while cooking remaining sandwiches.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, top French toast with warm strawberry glaze and sliced fresh strawberries and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.
